Topics decided, discussed:

1. Make weekly reports.
2. Squash commits if the commit is not meaningful in any way.
3. Time tracking does not need to be super duper honest.
4. The word "meeting" means to call up or get together for up to 30 min.
5. "Long meeting" the one we would do after every milestone can vary (I would say like two or more hours)
6. Use code formatters and linting to make a uniform code base.
7. Peer reviews in merge requests should preferably be looked at by everyone, but at minimum there should be at least one person who approved.
8. We will have branches called master and development. After every milestone finish, the development branch is merged into master.
9. We are using British English during all project spheres (reports, documents, coding, UI).
