# REST API ROUTES FOR COMMUNICATING

This is documentation on how information is flowing through REST API.

Based on the architecture information flows like this: <br>
Angular -> Spring -> PostgreSQL <br>
Angular <- Spring <- PostgreSQL <br>
OR <br>
Angular -> Spring -> Python -> Spring -> PostgreSQL <br>
Angular <- Spring <- PostgreSQL

For available routes see: [Spring section](#spring) and [Python section](#python)

##### STATUS CODES:

```
200	                OK	                Everything worked as expected.
400	                Bad Request	        The request was unacceptable, often due to missing a required parameter.
402	                Request Failed	    The parameters were valid but the request failed.
404	                Not Found	        The requested resource doesnâ€™t exist.
409	                Conflict	        The request conflicts with another request.
429	                Too Many Requests	Too many requests hit the API too quickly. We recommend an exponential backoff of your requests.
500, 502, 503, 504	Server Errors	    Something went wrong on server end.
```

Any returned response code that is not 200 needs to have an error attribute which specifies the error:

```json
{
  "error": "error message"
}
```

All API routes shall start with `/api` and the following routes are added on to it, for example GET all users:

```bash
curl -X GET "http://193.284.91.104:15387/api/users" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
```
